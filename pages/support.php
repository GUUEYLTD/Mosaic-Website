            <h2>Management / Support</h2>
            <h3 id="q1">Do I need training for me and my staff?</h3>
            <p>
              Mosaic has been created around the User Experience principal (UX), with a focus on being intuitive and easy-to-use.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will need a few days to adapt yourself to the software but once you have understood how one module works, you are then ready to use and work on the entire software.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our support team is here in case of any questions, please don’t hesitate to <a class="mosaic-link" href="/pages/contact.php">contact us</a>.

            <h2>Regulation - CQC</h2>

            <h3 id="q8">What happens to old records of service users who are no longer in my Care Home?</h3>
            <p>
              They remain in our system but are archived and do not appear in the main dashboard anymore. If a service user is returns to your care home, you can re-activate the profile and the data will reappear.
  Mosaic currently caters to care homes, which require records to be stored for 7 years. We comply with this requirement by storing archived user data for 7 years. We will issue a warning that user data will be removed when it approaches the end of the 7 year period.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q9">How can Mosaic help with CQC requirements </h3>
            <p>
              Mosaic will help with your daily care home management and adherence to the 5 main requirements from the CQC :

            <h2>Technical - Equipment</h2>

            <h3 id="q10">What equipment do I need ? </h3>
            <p>
              Mosaic is an intuitive care home management software, which can be used on different devices. Either on your desktop, laptop, as well as tablet and mobile. Mosaic is an adaptive web-app, which means we have worked on different designs to adapt to your favorite device.
  Tablets are the preferred device for use with our application. However, desktops, laptops, or smartphones with a screen at least 300 pixels wide will work as well. Some functionality may be reduced when using a phone.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q11">How many tablet / desktops do I need </h3>
            <p>
              The more devices you have, the easier it will be to use the software within your home. We recommend your account manager get in contact with us so that we can evaluate your needs depending on the size of your care home
