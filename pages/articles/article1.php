          <h2> A modular care home management solution designed to improve care provision and care home management.  </h2>

          <p>Guuey Ltd is proud to launch Mosaic, a modular and intuitive care home management system, created using brand new technology. Mosaic includes different <a style="color: #186ddd;" href="../modules/care_plan_module.php">modules</a>  to assist with the daily life of care home management, helping homes to provide the highest quality of care.</p>
          <p>With over 10 years of experience in the care home industry, Guuey’s aim was to develop a care home management solution able to improve the performance of each Care Home and help them to reach an Outstanding CQC level. </p>
          <p>The software offers a comprehensive range of user-friendly features across every area of care home management and gives staff more time to care for residents, rather than filling in paperwork. The move from a paper based system to digital records is becoming a higher priority for every care home. </p>
          <p>Before it’s launch, Mosaic went through testing at Beecholme (a carehome of 12 service users) for 6 months. Staff at Beecholme have been really enthusiastic about Mosaic and the way it has helped them work. Recording information is now quick and easy and the quality of the care plans produced is of a very high standard. The response from the users has been extremely positive, with a lot of comments made on how easy to use and intuitive the software is.</p>
          <p>Myron Agyiri, the founder of Guuey Ltd and creator of Mosaic, is excited about the potential for Mosaic to work in the care industry. Each Care Home has the responsibility to record and evidence every aspect of the care they provide and the app makes writing, storing, and retrieving these records simple and fast.</p>
          <p>Mosaic is the best solution for helping Care Homes to meet their regulatory requirements and ensuring they can spend quality time with the service users.</p>
