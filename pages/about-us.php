            Mosaic is a product of Guuey Ltd, a digital agency expert in developing intuitive and easy to use business software solutions. Our main ambition is to create designs with functionality that meet your businessâ€™ needs, help you achieve your goals faster, and deliver a successful product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our international team is a group of young & talented creatives whose focus has been on delivering a software product that covers all the daily management needs of a care home. Many of our staff have worked in care homes themselves, and have first hand experience in what the daily requirements of care homes are. We have thoroughly tested our software within operational care homes and used the staff feedback to refine our product.

          <p>
            We found that many care homes were still using paper based management systems and were losing a lot of time and energy filling out and dealing with all the paperwork. Many common problems arose such as lost documents, lack of storage space, illegible writing leading to potentially dangerous mistakes, and long handover meetings going through all the paper documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            We strived to create a simplified & improved version of the paper forms used currently that speed up administration and improve efficiency. The user friendly system helps to streamline daily processes for care home workers and managers, allowing them to spend more quality time with the service users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mosaic covers all aspects of care provision including: care plans, records, reports, communication, administration, meal planning, health & safety, medication, policies & procedures, training, analytics, staff management and more.
